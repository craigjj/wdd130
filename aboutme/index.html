        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Craig, but my dad calls me Ray(I still don't know why).<br> I was born in Murrieta, 
            California and I now live in Idaho Falls, Idaho <br>with my wife and five month old daughter. My 
            major is in Software Engineering.<br>I love videogames, especially RPG's like 
            <a href="https://thewitcher.com/en/witcher3/" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher</em></a>
            and <a href="https://godofwar.playstation.com/" target="_blank"><em>God of War</em></a>. 
            I have been <br>into aquariums and fish since I was about twelve years old. <br>I currently
            work the exciting job of delivering pizza for Pizza Hut! So it would be <br>safe to say that 
            my education is going to change my career path.
            I love how simple<br> web design can be for beginners like me. I hope to learn as much as
            I can in both front end and<br> back end web devlopment. I was born into the Church, of which 
            I am extremely grateful.<br>
